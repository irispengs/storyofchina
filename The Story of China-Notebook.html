<h2 class='sectionHeading'>1. Roots</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 19 &middot; Location 308</div><div class='noteText'>For most of its history , however , the heartland of the two rivers was China . It was only in the eighteenth century that the much bigger shape of today’s People’s Republic was determined by the huge multi - racial empire of the Manchus – the Qing dynasty , which spread its rule over Mongolia , Xinjiang and its Tibetan protectorate .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 20 &middot; Location 326</div><div class='noteText'>So the Yellow River is a constant , unpredictable and often terrifying character in the story of China ,</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 20 &middot; Location 326</div><div class='noteText'>no wonder china is characterized by sm chaos</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 21 &middot; Location 331</div><div class='noteText'>Vestiges of the cult of the River God survive even today , for example at the ancient village of Chayu near Heyang , next door to the Grand Historian Sima Qian’s hometown , where each year in late summer , on the fifteenth day of the sixth lunar month , ceremonies are still held for the rising .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 22 &middot; Location 347</div><div class='noteText'>So China’s early civilisations grew up on the banks of the river in the middle plain , where the fear of the breakdown of society due to natural disaster was ever - present , and irrigation could only be managed by a strong state . Not surprisingly , then , the earliest Chinese myths about state origins converge on stories about the control of water , tales that focus on the mythical king Great Yu , ‘ the tamer of the flood ’ .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 25 &middot; Location 407</div><div class='noteText'>Because of her influence on marriage , childbirth and auspiciousness , however , the veneration of Nüwa is the most important of the pilgrimage rituals .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 26 &middot; Location 419</div><div class='noteText'>their dance was taught to their female ancestors by Nüwa herself and only women know and perform it .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 27 &middot; Location 450</div><div class='noteText'>After all the shocks and the wholesale changes of the past eighty years , these stories and myths , ‘ old ideas , customs and belief ’ , are again part of the culture ; not as they were once , it is true , for the break was traumatic , but nonetheless real and still evolving – new , yet still the same . A metaphor perhaps for the whole story of the survival of traditional Chinese culture in the twentieth century .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 39 &middot; Location 650</div><div class='noteText'>While the evidence awaits full publication , what we can say for now is that a series of ecological crises between 2300 and 1900 BCE , including perhaps a great Yellow River flood , appear to coincide with dramatic political changes in the central plain . A social reconfiguration of the earlier Longshan society took place , which led to the emergence of the first dynasty in the Luoyang basin , where elements of these different regional cultures combined to create the first monarchy , the ancestor of all later Chinese dynasties .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 43 &middot; Location 713</div><div class='noteText'>Forms of tortoise shell divination still exist in rural Taiwan and in the teeming tenements of Hong Kong’s New Territories .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 46 &middot; Location 764</div><div class='noteText'>But it created the model for later Chinese kingship : the central role of the king as mediator between heaven and earth ; the crucial importance of lineage and ancestors ; the control of shamanism and divination as a source of authority ; and the monopoly of bronze technology , and of writing .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>2. The Great War of the Shang</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 57 &middot; Location 943</div><div class='noteText'>in China the physical fabric of buildings is of less importance than the sense of place . They may be rebuilt many times , but the key thing is to hand on the stories .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>4. The First Emperor and the Unification of China</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 97 &middot; Location 1613</div><div class='noteText'>Short - lived as it was , the Qin empire bequeathed a legacy that has informed every period of government that followed , through many dynasties , down to the Republic , to Mao and even today’s People’s Republic : the principle that authority over a united China stems from a single source of power , which is both the executive and the dispenser of law</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>6. The Glory of the Tang</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 146 &middot; Location 2421</div><div class='noteText'>Liu’s interest in the accurate recording of words , his critical attitude to the classics and his insistence that history should not deal in myths , but only take in human factors , economics , climate and geography , were part of a core concern for objectivity , which would be a recurring issue in Chinese historiography until the present day .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 148 &middot; Location 2465</div><div class='noteText'>The early 750s saw an unprecedented series of calamities , which , in the end , for all its administrative solidity , undermined the state</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 148 &middot; Location 2466</div><div class='noteText'>always against chaos</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 152 &middot; Location 2531</div><div class='noteText'>At the heart of this collective memory was Du Fu’s poetry , which came to be seen as the touchstone of the Confucian voice that speaks with unwavering moral integrity , the embodiment of China’s moral conscience ,</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 152 &middot; Location 2537</div><div class='noteText'>His writings are a sustained articulation of remembrance in the face of loss that that runs right through Chinese literary history :</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 152 &middot; Location 2541</div><div class='noteText'>the state is destroyed but the country remains ’ . At the heart of his poetry was grief for what was , and for what could have been .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 153 &middot; Location 2548</div><div class='noteText'>Weeping in the wilderness , how many families know of war and loss , Barbarian songs in scattered places rise from fishermen and woodcutters . Sleeping Dragon Zhuge Liang , Leaping Horse Gongsun Shu , heroes turned to brown dust . All word of events in the human world lost in these vast silent spaces .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>7. Decline and Fall</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 156 &middot; Location 2600</div><div class='noteText'>Optimism was a key theme in the book , along with a Confucian belief in the moral advancement of society by ‘ transformative education ’ and a faith in what we would describe today as consultative autocracy – ‘ despotism with Chinese characteristics ’ .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 170 &middot; Location 2819</div><div class='noteText'>The intense drama of the Tang’s final decline is overshadowed by the sheer violence of the events , but deeper causes lie in what historians and anthropologists have termed systems collapse , pointing to the other great breakdowns in Chinese history : the collapse of the Mongol Yuan dynasty in the early fourteenth century ; the decline and fall of the Ming between the late sixteenth and mid - seventeenth centuries ; and the fall of the Qing which led to China’s twentieth - century revolutions . These four giant crises are deep - rooted in China’s cultural memory , in historiography , literature , poetry and in popular culture .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>8. The Five Dynasties</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 177 &middot; Location 2924</div><div class='noteText'>Aristotle had earlier denied any kind of moral equivalence between humans and animals , as did the Hebrew Bible , saying that ‘ animals exist for human use as plants do for animals ’ . But in ancient China there were other views . Mencius himself had thought that a humane person’s attitude to animals should be that ‘ once having seen them alive he cannot bear to see them die , and once having heard their cry he cannot bear to eat their flesh ’ .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 177 &middot; Location 2927</div><div class='noteText'>how might this form traditional notions of food and alt protein?</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>9. The Song Renaissance</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 186 &middot; Location 3077</div><div class='noteText'>As happened later in Western history , increased knowledge of the Other helped to define the meaning of the state to its citizens and developed loyalty to the newly defined idea of China .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 191 &middot; Location 3151</div><div class='noteText'>But , as so often in China , the essential survival of a great historic city is not so much in buildings , in bricks and stone , but in prose , poetry and paint</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 197 &middot; Location 3248</div><div class='noteText'>Unlike the Tang , then , the elite of Song China were not hereditary nobles , or warlords , or bankers or merchants ( although of course only better - off families could afford to have their young men dedicate themselves to long years of study ) . They were the Confucian ‘ scholar - officials ’ , a governing elite that was unique in world history and would be for centuries . As the Jesuit Matteo Ricci observed in the early seventeenth century , echoing Plato , ‘ it is the best system of governance in the world , for here they really do have the rule of the philosophers ’ .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>10. The Fall of the Northern Song</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 206 &middot; Location 3400</div><div class='noteText'>Lake Baoding ,</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 206 &middot; Location 3400</div><div class='noteText'>baiyangdian lake in baoding to commemorate the flood of 1048</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 207 &middot; Location 3409</div><div class='noteText'>The local landowners , the rich and powerful , refused to cooperate with their magistrate , not wanting to expend a huge effort for regional infrastructure when they could protect themselves with local defences . So Linghu now held meetings with the smaller people , the local landowners and poorer farmers , and they agreed to build the proposed dyke themselves , maintaining it for years after Linghu had gone .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>12. The Yuan: China Under the Mongol Empire</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 260 &middot; Location 4279</div><div class='noteText'>The general consensus is that , though China’s population was around 120 million on the eve of the Mongol conquest around 1200 , it was only half that number by the late 1300s .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>16. The Opium Wars and the Taiping</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 402 &middot; Location 6599</div><div class='noteText'>In New Year 1843 , only months after the Treaty of Nanjing signalled China’s defeat , Wei Yuan published his Treatise on the Maritime Kingdoms , a book of fundamental importance in modern China</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 402 &middot; Location 6600</div><div class='noteText'>ideas reflected in chinas desire for influence in the scs region</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>18. The Age of Reform: From the Republic to Mao</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 472 &middot; Location 7731</div><div class='noteText'>‘ The state is destroyed , but the country remains . ’</h3>
